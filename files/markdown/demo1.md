# Abstract

The hydrologic effect of replacing pasture or other short crops with trees is reasonably well understood on a mean annualbasis. The impact on flow regime, as described by the annual flow duration curve (FDC) is less certain. A method to assess theimpact of plantation establishment on FDCs was developed. The starting point for the analyses was the assumption that rainfalland vegetation age are the principal drivers of evapotranspiration. A key objective was to remove the variability in the rainfallsignal, leaving changes in streamflow solely attributable to the evapotranspiration of the plantation. A method was developed to(1) fit a model to the observed annual time series of FDC percentiles; i.e. 10th percentile for each year of record with annualrainfall and plantation age as parameters, (2) replace the annual rainfall variation with the long term mean to obtain climateadjusted FDCs, and (3) quantify changes in FDC percentiles as plantations age. Data from 10 catchments from Australia, SouthAfrica and New Zealand were used. The model was able to represent flow variation for the majority of percentiles at eight of the10 catchments, particularly for the 10–50th percentiles. The adjusted FDCs revealed variable patterns in flow reductions withtwo types of responses (groups) being identified. Group 1 catchments show a substantial increase in the number of zero flowdays, with low flows being more affected than high flows. Group 2 catchments show a more uniform reduction in flows acrossall percentiles. The differences may be partly explained by storage characteristics. The modelled flow reductions were in accordwith published results of paired catchment experiments. An additional analysis was performed to characterise the impact ofafforestation on the number of zero flow days $( N _ { \mathrm { z e r o } } )$ for the catchments in group 1. This model performed particularly well, andwhen adjusted for climate, indicated a significant increase in $N _ { \mathrm { z e r o } }$ . The zero flow day method could be used to determine changein the occurrence of any given flow in response to afforestation. The methods used in this study proved satisfactory in removingthe rainfall variability, and have added useful insight into the hydrologic impacts of plantation establishment. This approachprovides a methodology for understanding catchment response to afforestation, where paired catchment data is not available.

# 1. Introduction

Widespread afforestation through plantation estab-lishment on non-forested land represents a potentiallysignificant alteration of catchment evapotranspiration(ET). Using data collated from multiple catchmentstudies, researchers have demonstrated a consistentdifference in ET between forests and grass or shortcrops, and the relationship between ET and rainfall ona mean annual basis (Holmes and Sinclair, 1986;Vertessy and Bessard, 1999; Zhang et al., 1999,2001). Once annual rainfall exceeds $4 0 0 { - } 5 0 0 ~ \mathrm { m m }$ ,there is an increasing divergence between forest andgrassland ET (Zhang et al., 2001). Research fromSouth Africa in particular has demonstrated flowreduction following afforestation with both pine andeucalypt species (Bosch, 1979; Van Lill et al., 1980;Van Wyk, 1987; Bosch and Von Gadow, 1990; Scottand Smith, 1997; Scott et al., 2000). In regions, wherewater is an increasingly valuable resource, predictionof the long-term hydrologic impact of afforestation isa prerequisite for the optimal planning of catchmentland use.

Zhang et al. (1999, 2001) developed simple andeasily parameterised models to predict changes inmean annual flows following afforestation. However,there is a need to consider the annual flow regime as therelative changes in high and low flows may haveconsiderable site specific and downstream impacts..Sikka et al. (2003) recently showed a change fromgrassland to Eucalyptus globulus plantations in Indiadecreased a low flow index by a factor of two during thefirst rotation (9 years), and by 3.75 during the secondrotation, with more subdued impact on peak flows. Theindex was defined as the 10 day average flow exceeded$9 5 \%$ of the time, obtained from analysis of 10-day flowduration curves. Scott and Smith (1997) reportedproportionally greater reductions in low flows(75–100th percentiles) than annual flows from SouthAfrican research catchments under conversions fromgrass to pine and eucalypt plantations, while Bosch(1979) found the greatest reduction in seasonal flowfrom the summer wet season. Fahey and Jackson(1997) reported the reduction in peak flows was twicethat of total flow and low flows for pine afforestation inNew Zealand. The generalisations that can be drawnfrom annual analyses, where processes and hydrologicresponses are to a certain extent integrated may notapply on a seasonal or shorter scale. Further, theobserved impacts of any land use change on flows maybe exaggerated or understated depending on theprevailing climate. Observations of flow duringextended wet or dry spells, or with high annualvariability can obscure the real impacts. Fig. 1 plotsannual FDCs over 12 years of plantation growth for oneof the catchments used in this study, Pine Creek. Thenet change in flow is obscured by rainfall variability;e.g. the greatest change in the FDC is in 1996, with thestream flowing $< 2 0 \%$ of the time. This may becompared with 2000, where there is substantiallyhigher flows.

This paper presents the results of a project aimed atquantifying changes in annual flow regime ofcatchments following plantation establishment. Theflow regime is represented by the flow duration curve(FDC). The key assumption was that rainfall andforest age are the principal drivers of evapotranspira-tion. For any generalisation of response of the FDC tovegetation change, the variation in the annual climatesignal must be removed. The time-tested solution tothis problem is the paired-catchment (control versustreatment) experiment. The benefits in such studiesare manifold: unambiguous measures of trends,insights into the processes driving those trends,excellent opportunities for model parameterisationand validation. However these data are not readilyavailable for the range of treamtments and environ-ments required. Consequently, the aims of this projectwere to (1) fit a model to the observed annual timeseries of FDC percentiles; i.e. 10th percentile for eachyear of record with annual rainfall and plantation ageas parameters, (2) replace the annual rainfall variationwith the long term mean to obtain climate adjustedFDCs, and (3) quantify changes in FDC percentiles asplantations age. If the climate signal, represented byrainfall, could be successfully removed, the resultingchanges in the FDC would be solely attributable to thevegetation.

# 2. Methods

# 2.1. Characterisation of flow regime

Flow duration curves display the relationshipbetween streamflow and the percentage of timethe streamflow is exceeded as a cumulative densityfunction They can be constructed for any time period(daily, weekly, monthly, etc.) and provide a graphicaland statistical view of historic streamflow variabilityin a single catchment or a comparison of inter-catchment flow regimes. Vogel and Fennessey (1994)and Smakhtin (1999, 2001) demonstrate the utility(and caveats) of FDCs in characterising, comparingand predicting flow regimes at varying temporalscales. Fig. 1 is an example of annual FDCsconstructed from daily flows. For the considerationof annual flow regime, daily flows are an appropriatetime step for FDC construction.

FDCs were computed from the distribution of dailyflows for each year of record based on the appropriatewater years (May–April or November–October) for10 Southern Hemisphere catchments. Each 10thpercentile (decile) was extracted from the annualFDCs of each catchment to form the data sets foranalysis. For the purpose of characterising changes ineach of the deciles, it is assumed that the time series isprincipally a function of climate and vegetationcharacteristics. Given rainfall is generally the mostimportant factor affecting streamflow and the mosteasily accessed data, it is chosen to represent theclimate. Catchment physical properties such as soilproperties and topography are assumed to be timeinvariant and therefore their impact on runoff isconsidered constant throughout the analysis. As treesintercept and transpire at increasing rates until canopyclosure, a time term is required to represent plantationgrowth. A simple model relating the time series ofeach decile with rainfall and vegetation characteristicscan be expressed as:

$$
Q _ { \% } = f ( P ) + g ( T )
$$

where $Q \%$ is the percentile flow, $f ( P )$ is a function ofrainfall and $g ( T )$ is a function of the age of theplantation. Annual rainfall was chosen as the rainfallstatistic as it proved to be the most robust predictor offlow over the whole range of flow percentiles, ascompared with rainfall percentiles; e.g. median rain-fall versus 10th flow percentile. The use of annualrainfall also minimises parameter complexity. Thechoice of model form is dependent on selecting afunction that describes the relationship between forestage and ET. Scott and Smith (1997) demonstratedcumulative reductions in annual and low flowsresulting from afforestation fitted a sigmoidalfunction, similar to forest growth functions. Conse-quently, we used a sigmoidal function to characterisethe impact of plantation growth on each flow decile.Fig. 2a is a schematic of the change in the FDC overtime. The model took the form:

$$
Q _ { \mathcal { Y } } = a + b ( \Delta P ) + \frac { Y } { 1 + \exp \left( \frac { T - T _ { \mathrm { h a l f } } } { S } \right) }
$$

where $Q \%$ is the percentile flow (i.e. $Q _ { 5 0 }$ is the 50thpercentile flow), $Y$ and $s$ are coefficients of thesigmoidal term, $\Delta P$ is the deviation of annual rainfallfrom the period of record average, and $T _ { \mathrm { h a l f } }$ is the timein years at which half of the reduction in $Q \%$ due toafforestation has taken place. For the average climatecondition $\Delta P { = } 0$ , $a$ becomes the value of $Q \%$ whenthe new equilibrium plantation water use underafforestation is reached. Y then gives the magnitudeof change due to afforestation, and $s$ describesthe shape of the response as shown in Fig. 2b. Forthe average pre-treatment condition $\Delta P { = } 0$ at $T { = } 0$ ,$Q \%$ approximately equals $a + Y .$ . Estimation of a pre-afforestation condition would not require the timeterm. Details of the optimisation scheme andsensitivity tests on initial parameter values are givenin Lane et al. (2003).

# 2.2. Zero flow day analysis

A notable feature of Fig. 1 is the increase in thenumber of zero flow days. A similar approach toEq. (2), using an inverse sigmoidal function wasemployed to assess the impact of afforestation on thenumber of zero flow days per year $( N _ { \mathrm { z e r o } } )$ . In this case,the left hand side of Eq. (2) is replaced by $N _ { \mathrm { z e r o } }$ , and $^ b$and $s$ are constrained to negative as $N _ { \mathrm { z e r o } }$ decreases asrainfall increases, and increases with plantationgrowth:

$$
N _ { \mathrm { z e r o } } = a + b ( \Delta P ) + \frac { Y } { 1 + \exp \left( \frac { T - T _ { \mathrm { h a f f } } } { S } \right) }
$$

For the average pre-treatment condition $\Delta P { = } 0$and $T { = } 0 , \ N _ { \mathrm { z e r o } }$ approximately equals $a , \ Y$ givesthe magnitude of change in zero flow days due toafforestation, and $s$ describes the shape of theresponse. For the average climate condition $\Delta P { = } 0$ ,$a + Y$ becomes the number of zero flow days when thenew equilibrium condition under afforestation isreached.

# 2.3. Statistical analyses

The coefficient of efficiency $( E )$ (Nash andSutcliffe, 1970; Chiew and McMahon, 1993; Legatesand McCabe, 1999) was used as the ‘goodness of fit’measure to evaluate the fit between observed andpredicted flow deciles (2) and zero flow days (3). $E$ isgiven by:

$$
E = 1 . 0 - \frac { \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { N } ( O _ { i } - P _ { i } ) ^ { 2 } } { \sum _ { i = 1 } ^ { N } ( O _ { i } - \bar { O } ) ^ { 2 } }
$$

where $o$ are observed data, $P$ are predicted values,and $\bar { O }$ is the mean for the entire period. $E$ is unityminus the ratio of the mean square error to thevariance in the observed data, and ranges from $- \infty$ to1.0. Higher values indicate greater agreement betweenobserved and predicted data as per the coefficient ofdetermination $( r ^ { 2 } )$ . $E$ is used in preference to $r ^ { 2 }$ inevaluating hydrologic modelling because it is ameasure of the deviation from the 1:1 line. As $E$ isalways $< r ^ { 2 }$ we have arbitrarily considered $E > 0 . 7$ toindicate adequate model fits.

It is important to assess the significance of themodel parameters to check the model assumptionsthat rainfall and forest age are driving changes in theFDC. The model (2) was split into simplified forms,where only the rainfall or time terms were included bysetting $b = 0$ , as shown in Eq. (5), or $Y { = } 0$ as shown inEq. (6). The component models (5) and (6) were thentested against the complete model, (2).

$$
Q _ { \mathcal { I } _ { \theta } } = a + \frac { Y } { 1 + \exp ( \frac { T - T _ { \mathrm { h a l f } } } { S } ) }
$$

and

$$
Q _ { \% } = a + b \Delta P
$$

For both the flow duration curve analysis and zeroflow days analysis, a $t { \cdot }$ -test was then performed to testwhether (5) and (6) were significantly different to (2).A critical value of $t$ exceeding the calculated $t$ -valuewhen comparing (5) and (2) would indicate the timeterm in (6) was required to improve the completemodel and is therefore significant, and vice versa.

Due to the constraint that the rainfall and time termmust be positive, a one tailed $t \cdot$ -test was applied. The$t \cdot$ -value was calculated as $F ^ { 0 . 5 }$ , and compared withthe critical value for significance at the 0.05 level.The $F .$ -statistic was calculated as:

# 3. Data sets

Daily streamflow data were obtained from 10catchment studies from southeastern Australia, NewZealand and South Africa. The initial criteria forselection of these catchments were a known veg-etation history and streamflow records of goodquality. The ideal data sets were those with a lengthypre- and post-treatment (plantation establishment)flow record with approximately $100 \%$ of the catch-ment converted from grassland or a crop equivalent toplantation. In reality, all these criteria were not easy tosatisfy. For example in Victoria, Australia, the bestdata is from Stewarts Creek, a set of decommissionedresearch catchments with 9 years of pre-treatmentdata and 25 years of post-treatment. Here, though, thetreatment was a conversion from native eucalyptforest to pine. The assumption made for this data set isthat the immediate post-treatment period may beviewed as a non-forested condition. This condition islikely to approximate the ET conditions of pasture orshort crops for up to 3 years. Catchment details andtreatments are given in Table 1.

All catchments, with the exception of TraralgonCreek, were afforested with pine species, predomi-nantly Pinus radiata, with $P _ {  }$ . patula planted at the twoCathedral Peak catchments. Traralgon Creek has only$6 \%$ pine, with the remainder eucalypts species, mostof which is Eucalyptus regnans.

Data on soil characteristics have been obtainedfrom published reports and personal communicationwith researchers, but is far from uniform, particularlyregarding porosity. Consequently only an indicationof mean depth is reported here. However, this doesgive some indication of the likely relative storagecapacities of the catchments. To obtain insights intothe pre-afforestation hydrologic characteristics abaseflow separation was performed on the dailyflows for the first 3 years following disturbance,using the digital filtering method of Lyne and Hollick(1979) with a filter coefficient of 0.925 and threepasses. The resultant average baseflow index (BFI),the ratio of baseflow to total flow, is given in Table 1.The Australian catchments display a notablylower BFI than the South African and New Zealandcatchments. For Stewarts Creek, Pine Creekand Redhill the lower BFI is matched by the shallowsoils. Pre-treatment data is not available for allcatchment in the data set, so it was decided for thesake of consistency in the analysis to start each of thedata sets in the year of treatment. The FDCs wereconstructed for water years of May–April for eightcatchments. The 2 Cathedral Peak catchments wereanalysed for November–October because of thesummer rainfall maxima (Table 2).

# 4. Results

# 4.1. Model evaluation

The fit of the complete model, Eq. (2), to theobserved data was generally good. Table 2 givesthe coefficient of efficiency $( E )$ for each flowpercentile at all the catchments. The majority of fits$( 7 7 \% )$ returned $E > 0 . 7$ , with $6 0 \% 0 . 8$ or better. Thesignificance of the rainfall and time terms is given inTable 3 for all deciles, where solutions were found.There were not enough data to fit the model in fiveinstances because of extended periods of zero flows.This problem is addressed to some extent in the zeroflow analysis. If the rainfall signal is to be separatedfrom the vegetation signal the rainfall terms must besignificant. This term, $^ b$ , was significant for $7 5 \%$ ofthe deciles at the 0.05 level, and a further $9 \%$ at the0.10 level. The incidence of significance was greatestfor the 10–50th percentiles at 45 of the 50 data sets atthe 0.05 level. The time term, $Y$ returned similarresults, with $80 \%$ of the deciles significant at 0.05level. There were an additional $9 \%$ of decilessignificant at the 0.10 level.

ns Indicates that no solution was found, and na denotes deciles with too few data points for analysis.

The poorest $E$ values were those from Lambrechts-bos A and B. The high $E$ for 50–100th deciles atBiesievlei, where $^ b$ was not significant are notable. Ingeneral the model fits the higher flows (lower deciles)better, most of the poorer fits are in the 80–100percentile range. This can be expected given the resultsof the significance tests for $^ b$ . The results of thesensitivity analysis suggested that the $E$ values forGlendhu 2 and for 10th and 20th percentiles fromCathedral Peak 3 may exaggerate the goodness of fit tothe exact form of the model (Lane et al., 2003).

# 4.2. Adjusted FDCs—magnitude of flow reductions

Following the successful fitting of (2) to theobserved percentiles, the FDCs were adjusted forclimate by setting $\Delta P$ to zero, representing long termaverage annual rainfall. The climate adjusted FDCsproduce an estimation of the change in flowpercentiles over time for each catchment due toafforestation that may be viewed in two forms: newFDCs, adjusted for climate, as exemplified in Fig. 3for Stewarts Creek 5, and a comparison between allcatchments of the maximum change in yield (given byY) for each flow percentile from baseline flows (givenby $a + Y )$ as shown in Fig. 4. Where the newequilibrium of maximum water use is reached, theadjusted FDCs for individual years should be identicalif rainfall variability has been accounted for. The newequilibrium is approximately reached for $T = 2 T _ { \mathrm { h a l f } }$ .

$T _ { \mathrm { h a l f } }$ values are given in Table 4. Fig. 3 shows that formost deciles the adjusted FDCs are identical for 12and 20 years after treatment. This figure clearlydemonstrates the necessity for FDC adjustment,particularly for the 20 years FDC.

The relative net flow change due to afforestation isgiven by $Y / ( Y + a )$ , which represents the change from theold equilibrium water use condition of pre-treatmentvegetation to the new equilibrium condition at forestcanopy closure. This quantity is plotted for all catchmentsin Fig. 4. Some deciles have been removed from the dataset, the 10th and 50th percentile for Glendhu 2 and the10th and 20th percentiles from Cathedral Peak 3. Theoptimised value of a was zero or near zero for these cases,which is not consistent with the conceptual model. Thechanges shown in Fig. 4 are variable. However, there aresome commonalities between catchment responses. Twotypes of responses (groups) were identified. Group 1catchments show a substantial increase in the number ofzero flow days, with a greater proportional reduction inlow flows than high flows. Group 2 catchments show amore uniform proportional reduction in flows across allpercentiles, albeit with some variability. The catchmentsin each group are:

Group 1 exhibit both the highest reduction offlows overall, and show the largest proportionalreduction at lower flows, leading to a completecessation of flow. Comparison of flow reductions ishindered slightly by the range of afforestation at thecatchments (Table 1). These results could be scaledup to $100 \%$ afforested if it is assumed there is alinear relationship between the area planted and flowreductions. As there is no evidence that this is thecase we have not presented scaled reductions here.Linear scaling would shift the reduction curvesupward for those catchments that are less than$100 \%$ afforested, but would not change the shapeof the curves or our groupings.

# 4.3. Timing of flow reductions

The speed of flow responses to afforestation can beevaluated by examining the value of $T _ { \mathrm { h a l f } }$ (Table 4). Thereis substantial variation in response times both over thepercentile spread in some individual catchments, andbetween the catchments. The majority of responses havea $T _ { \mathrm { h a l f } }$ value between 5 and 10 years. Pine Creek andStewarts Creek, Redhill and Lambrechtsbos A exhibit thefastest responses, with Biesievlei showing the mostuniformly slow response. $T _ { \mathrm { h a l f } }$ for the South Africancatchments display a good correspondence to publishedannual changes (Scott et al., 2000; Van Wyk, 1987),excepting the 10–20th deciles for both Cathedral Peakcatchments and the lower deciles at Lambrechtsbos B.The $T _ { \mathrm { h a l f } }$ from Glendhu 2 appears to be substantiallylower than other published data (Fahey and Jackson,1997).

# 4.4. Comparison with paired catchment studies

A further check on the overall model performance isa comparison with published results of paired catchmentstudies. The data that can be compared with our resultsare presented in Table 5 and can be broadly comparedwith Fig. 4. These data are reductions in years with nearaverage annual rainfall, and at a time after treatmentwhen maximum changes in streamflow have occurred.Table 5 also includes estimates on the total and low flowreductions calculated from this study. Results from PineCreek and Traralgon Creek are not included in Table 5as these catchments are not paired. Exact comparisonsare impossible because of the rainfall variability, andlack of calibration period for Redhill. Despite this,Table 5 shows that total and low flow reductionsestimated from our study are comparable to the resultsfrom paired catchment studies, indicating that oursimple model has successfully removed the rainfallsignal.

# 4.5. Zero flow days

As this analysis could only be applied, where therewas consistent drying up of streams, it was confined toStewarts Creek, Pine Creek and Redhill catchments. Themodel returned values of $E$ of 0.95, 0.99 and 0.99,respectively. The $t \cdot$ -tests on $^ b$ and $\Delta N _ { \mathrm { z e r o } }$ returnedsignificant results at the 0.05 level for both parameters atall three catchments. The climate adjusted zero flowdays are shown in Fig. 5. The increases in zero flow daysare substantial with flows confined to less than $50 \%$ ofthe time by year 8 at Stewarts $\mathrm { C k }$ and Pine $\mathrm { C k }$ and year11 at Redhill. The latter has changed from an almostpermanent to a highly intermittent stream. The curvesare also in sensible agreement with the flow reductionsin Fig. 4.

# 5. Discussion

The aims of the project have largely been met. Thegeneral characterisation of FDCs and adjustment forclimate has been very encouraging given the task offitting our model to 10 flow percentiles, for 10 differentcatchments (resulting in 100 model fits) withsubstantially varying spatial scales, soils and geology,species planted and climatic environments. Althoughthere were poor results for individual deciles, the FDCsat eight of the 10 catchments were adequately describedby Eq. (2). The results of the statistical tests in which therainfall term was significant for most deciles demon-strated the model structure was appropriate for adjustingthe FDCs for climatic (rainfall) variability. Thecomparisons of our results with published pairedcatchment analyses are satisfactory, although thedifferent methodologies make direct comparisons ofdeciles with total flow uncertain. Low flows at

Fig. 5. Number of zero flow days for average rainfall followingafforestation for Stewarts Creek 5, Redhill and Pine Creek,Australia.

Lambrechtsbos B appear to be over-estimated by ourmodel, which is unsurprising as the model fit was poor.The remaining four South African catchments, and alsoRedhill and Stewarts Creek are in good agreement withthe published values, particularly when the deviation ofaverage rainfall is considered. Glendhu 2 reductions areclose to the reported $27 \%$ , but our model producesa heavier impact on the lower flows. Overall, it appearsthere are no significant discrepancies with the publishedpaired catchment analyses. We suggest our techniquerepresents an alternative to the paired-catchment methodfor assessing hydrologic response to vegetation treat-ment, where paired data are unavailable. The methodhas not yet resulted in a predictive model, but hasincreased our knowledge of afforestation impacts. Thisis a valuable outcome given the contentious issue ofafforestation in Australia and other countries, and acurrent paucity of data on inter-annual flows. It shouldbe noted that nine of the 10 catchment were pine species.More data is required to compare the impact ofhardwood species, particularly eucalypts, on the FDC.Unfortunately these data are currently scarce. There aresubstantial data on the physiological controls of eucalyptwater use (see Whitehead and Beadle, 2004), but not atthe catchment scale.

The model fits show we have quantified the netimpact of afforestation for the majority of the flowpercentiles in the 10 catchments. Results for the 10–50thpercentiles were particularly encouraging. It is notsurprising that the relationship between rainfall and flowdiminishes at lower flows (60–100th percentile), whereseasonal storage effects and rainfall distribution becomemore important drivers for runoff generation. Thepoorest model fits were gained for Lambrechtsbos Aand B. The likely reason at Lambrechtsbos A is anobserved annual decrease in stand water use after 12years (Scott et al., 2000) which does not conform to thesigmoidal form of our model over the full 19 years ofrecord. The failure of the model to fit the lower flows atLambrechtsbos B is not as explicable. A decrease instand water use in this catchment is observed as theplantation ages, but does not occur during the first 20years after treatment (Scott et al., 2000). Other data fromSouth Africa (Scott et al., 2000) indicate there arediminished flow reductions as plantations age, but again,generally after 20 years. Our use of an asymptotic curveassumes a new equilibrium of stand water use isreached. The results of the model fitting generally justifythis assumption for the length of commercial plantationgrowth (up to 20 years) considered here. The physio-logical relationship between stand age and water use forplantation species other than $E .$ . regnans have not beenthoroughly investigated, although Cornish and Vertessy(2001) and Roberts et al. (2001) have shown youngmixed species eucalypt forests may use more water thanmature stands, and Putahena and Cordery (2000) suggestmaximum Pinus radiata water use may have beenreached after 12 years, with a subsequent decline.

The small Australian catchments converted to pine inresponse group 1 (Stewarts Creek 5, Pine Creek andRedhill) have similar shallow soils, potential evapo-transpiration and rainfall distribution (relatively uni-form) although Stewarts Creek is significantly wetter.The combination of small catchment area and theincreased transpirative demand that exceeds summerand autumn rainfall and stored water results in the largeimpact on lower flows, compared to high flows.

The magnitude of the response within Group 2 variesconsiderably, with greater reduction in flows in the twoCathedral Peak catchments, and Lambrechtsbos B.Potential evaporation is in phase with rainfall at theCathedral Peak sites as they receive $85 \%$ ( $1 2 6 0 \mathrm { m m }$ onaverage) of their rainfall in summer. The conjunction ofpeak demand and plant water availability may explainthe high reductions relative to the remaining catchmentsin Group 2. In addition, the stocking density wasdescribed as ‘abnormally dense’ by Scott et al. (2000).Growth at Glendhu 2 was notably slow (Fahey andJackson, 1997) and Lambrechtsbos A and Biesievlei aredescribed as being within sub optimal growth zones(Scott and Smith, 1997) characterised by these authorsas having relatively slow response times and lesserreductions that those at more optimal sites.

The response groups may be in part explained by thestorage characteristics of the catchments. Accuratemeasures of storage are not available from the literature,but the soil depths and the baseflow index (Table 1) bothshow the three south eastern Australian catchments withthe greatest reduction are likely to have the loweststorage capacity. The greater flow reductions, particu-larly for low flows, could be expected under theseconditions. Inclusion of a storage term in the model is anobvious option for improving the analysis. However theaddition of extra parameters would be at the cost ofmaintaining model simplicity, particularly as character-ising a transient storage is not trivial.

Traralgon Creek would be expected to have both themost subdued flow reductions and longer response timebecause of the large area of $E .$ regnans forest, anduncertain vegetation record. Peak stand water use of anatural stand of this species is around 30 years.Additionally in this large, ‘real world’ catchment,there is a continuous cycle of forest managementwhich includes harvesting. A mixture of pasture and‘scrub’, which could represent significant understoreystands, were replaced by plantation species. Conse-quently the difference between pre and post treatmentET may be less than at other catchments. Reductions ofthis magnitude could be more readily expected in larger,multi land use catchments than the very high impactsestimated at the smaller Australian catchments.

The analysis of zero flow days was successful,demonstrating that the impact on flow intermittence canbe evaluated without of the entire FDC. This was helpfulas the change in the higher percentiles (low flows) couldnot always be modelled. The results for the threecatchments analysed are a rather stark indication of thepotential for highly increased zero flow periods in smallcatchments, at least in south-eastern Australia. However,it should be noted these curves probably represent amaximum response as they are all derived from smallcatchments with small storage capacities and largepercentages of afforestation. This method could be usedto determine change in the occurrence of any given flowin response to afforestation; e.g. to determine thelikelihood of maintaining a reservoir storage or anenvironmental flow that requires an average critical flow.

# 6. Summary and conclusions

This project sought to (i) develop a method to removethe climate signal from streamflow records to identifythe impact of vegetation on flow from afforestedcatchments, and (ii) quantify this impact on the flowduration curve. A simple model was proposed thatconsidered the age of plantation and the annual rainfallto be the principal drivers for evapotranspiration. Thismodel was fitted to the observed deciles of the FDC, andthe climate signal was then removed from the stream-flow records by adjusting the FDC for average rainfallover the period of record. The model was tested andapplied to 10 afforested catchments. We successfullyfitted our model to catchments with varying spatialscales, species and environments, and have shown that itprovides a means of separating the influence of climateand vegetation on the FDCs. The modelled resultsshowed the greatest proportional impacts were formedian and lower flows. The flow reductions from thethree small catchments SE Australian were the highestand may reflect lower storages. The characterisation ofthe number of zero flow days was also successful forthese catchments in indicating a significant increase inzero flows. The flow reductions identified here probablyrepresent a maximum effect given the size of thecatchments, level of afforestation and the shallow soils.These results have yielded useful new insights on thecontentious issue of the hydrological impact ofafforestation. This research has led to the developmentof a method to assess the net impact of afforestation onthe flow duration curve which does not require paired-catchments to remove climatic variability.
